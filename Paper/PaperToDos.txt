Today's Paper to dos:

1. Address Qing's comment on "Identification of key model parameters..." section: expand on results and restate each parameter's influence
2. Put the one paragraph into the Methods section (currently sits just above the methods section)
4. Make sure no author names are present
5. Make sure I no longer say I'm improving the model, but rather study EMT
8. Elaborate on parameter sensitivity




7. Rephrase "non-monotonic relationship" in abstract
9. Attempt to connect 3.3-3.5 (make title more coherent?)
10. More detail of parameter values in figures
11. Give equation numbers 
12. Read sources Qing sent and add citations
13. Identify which cancers we're talking about
