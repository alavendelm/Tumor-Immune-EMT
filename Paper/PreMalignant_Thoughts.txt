This 2016 review on premalignant tumors does give some of the terminology and framework we would want for this model. I believe we could refer to our three pathway mutations as driver mutations ("a mutation that directly or indirectly confers a selective growth advantage to the cell in which it occurs").

One concern I have is what the literature says about EMT in pre-malignant tissue. Am I allowed to say that these pre-malignant cells have plasticity along the EMT spectrum?
	Found Cellular Plasticity in Cancer by Yuan. They use EMT as the classic example of plasticity in premalignant (and malignant) tissue that aids progression.

Another concern: This would shift the entire focus of the paper onto the transformation from pre-malignant to malignant tumors. They seemed to allude to the fact that progression is a separate step in cancer:
	"Our goal is to (re-) acknowledge that although there is a continuum between premalignant and malignant lesions, they are two different entities [1] and with differing propensities for progression"
	They continually use the term "progression", as well as "progress", throughout. It is not necessarily always as above: it is often used to refer to any forward movement of the cancer from normal tissue to metastatic disease.

They do mention the shared characteristic of pre-malignant and malignant tumors (using the Hallmarks of Cancer), but they did not comment directly on the immune component of that.
	Found Redirecting the focus of cancer immunotherapy to premalignant conditions by Young. They state that premalignant tumors often have immune influx with more immune cells correlating with better prognosis.
